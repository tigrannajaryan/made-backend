First, we want to thank each of our early users of the MadeBeauty app, our entire team has enjoyed working alongside so many talented stylists and their loyal clients as we brought our vision to life. A year ago, we founded the MADE app with a simple concept in mind, to connect clients and stylist at the best rates in the beauty industry and to keep clients coming back.

While we have seen a lot of early success with many of our users, including rebooking rates above industry average and hundreds of client bookings, we haven't found the fit in the market that we were looking to achieve at this point. As a result, we have recently made the difficult decision to scale down and discontinue the MadeBeauty client and stylist apps.

What does this mean for you?
We will keep both apps active through April 30th, 2019, to allow for a smoother transition.

What happens to my bank details?
We will not store or keep any bank details in our system.

What happens to my upcoming visits?
You can link all current bookings to your google calendar to keep them stored. And reach out to your stylist directly to confirm any upcoming visit time and date.

Thank you again for coming on our journey with us and supporting MADE!

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.
