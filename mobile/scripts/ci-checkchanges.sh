# IMPORTANT: if you edit this script, you have to make corresponding 
# changes to /webapp/scripts/ci-checkchanges.sh. This script is basically a 
# copy of it with different APP_DIR and changes_detected variable output.
# Main reason for duplicating the script (rather than having one unified)
# is to simplify possible dissection of repositories in the future.

# This scripts performs checks and sets mobileapp_changesdetected=1 variable
# in VSTS if it decides that it is neccessary to build the webapp.
# If the variable is not set to 1 then VSTS is configured to skip
# all subsequent build steps using Custom Condition in the following form
#   and(succeeded(), eq(variables['mobileapp_changesdetected'], '1'))

# The base branch to check changes against
BASE_BRANCH_NAME="develop"

# The directory to check the changes in. Any changes outside
# this directroy will not trigger the build.

# If yes then always build, don't check the changes.

# TODO #1: this is not actually the best approach since it still
# results in unnecessary builds if any commit to base branch is made.
# It would be better to check the commits on base branch starting
# from the last successful build of base branch and if these commits
# include changes in our directory then only in that case allow the build.
# However I do not yet see an easy way to know which commit was the last
# successful build of base branch. This is work for future.
#
# TODO #2: check the behavior for "master" branch and make sure it is
# what we want. I only tested "develop" branch and assumed it is the only
# base branch and ignored for now the fact that also have "master" branch.
