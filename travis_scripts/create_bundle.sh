# This script prepares .zip bundles to be deployed to Elastic Beanstalk.
# It prepares 2 bundles: bundles/staging.zip and bundles/production.zip
# These are the zip archives consisting of files from git ls-files command
# (which is the default behavior of travis's elasticbeanstalk deploy provider),
# and appropriate push notifications certificates are injected into each of
# the bundles.

# 1. Create staging and production bundles only with developer (local build)
# certificates, filtering out staging/and production; we'll add them later.

# We're going to use current git local copy file list - since this is
# the default behavior of travis's elasticbeanstalk provider, which
# uses `git ls-files` in the default mode of operation. We will exclude
# any encrypted push certificates at this time

# create bundle directory if it doesn't exist yet. If it exists - this means
# that bundles are already created, so just exit.
