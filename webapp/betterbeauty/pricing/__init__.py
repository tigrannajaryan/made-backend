    Calculate client prices for PRICE_BLOCK_SIZE days starting from today's date in stylists's
    timezone. For each particular day finds the maximum applicable discount. Then that
    discount is fully applied if the day's demand is minimal within all the days in the
    PRICE_BLOCK_SIZE. If the demand is higher than the minimal then the discount value
    is linearly interpolated so that zero discount corresponds to a fully booked day.
    The final applied discount is granularized, so that only some possible portions of
    discount percentage are ever used. This ensures that the prices don't jump around from
    minor demand fluctuations. See description of DISCOUNT_GRANULARIZATION for more details.

    The implemented simple heuristic approach has the following desirable characteritic:
    the discount applied is inverselly proportional to the demand, i.e. higher demand results in
    less discount and higher pricing. This is inline with our intuitive understanding of how
    the dynamic pricing should work.

    Note that the results of this function depend on the start date and block size
    (because we use minimum demand value in the block for the rest of calculations),
    that's why this function does not accept start date or block size as parameters.
    It helps ensure we always work with the same window of dates and the results are
    stable.

    Args:
        stylist_timezone: timezone of the stylist. Used to correctly determine today's date.

        discounts: the definitions of discounts for the stylist.

        last_visit_date: last time the client visited. None if they never visited (e.g.
            new client).

        regular_price: the regular price for the service.

        current_demand: A list of PRICE_BLOCK_SIZE items. Each item describes the demand for one
            day, the first item corresponds to today. The demand is a normalized number between 0
            and 1. 0 means there are no booked appointments for that day. 1 means the day is
            fully booked, no more appointments should be accepted. Usually calculated as
            (total booked time)/(total available time). normalize_demand() can be used to convert
            absolute demand values to normalized.

    Returns:
        A list of PRICE_BLOCK_SIZE items with prices. The first item represents today.

    Raises:
        ValueError exception on invalid input.
